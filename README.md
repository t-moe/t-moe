## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Timo !

I'm a software developer passionate about all things non-GUI! My work and interests center around systems programming and low-level development. You'll find me mostly working on projects in Rust, C++, Linux, and embedded systems.

I also have my own consulting business and am available to help with software development needs, especially for systems-level and embedded projects.

### ðŸ›  Current Side-Projects for embedded rust:
* Continue to improve [embedded-test](https://lib.rs/crates/embedded-test)
* Improve defmt: Add feature-flag to redirect to log, runtime level filter
* Create a new defmt sink that allows storing logs in flash, and recovering them with easy tooling.
